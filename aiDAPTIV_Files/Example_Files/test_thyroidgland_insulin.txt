In adipose cells, insulin converts excess glucose to fat.
The pancreas is responsible for maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels within the normal range of 75–110 mg/100 ml. Langerhans cells in the pancreas produce and secrete insulin and glucose continuously into the bloodstream to regulate blood sugar levels. The actions of both these hormones and the mechanism of homeostasis work together to maintain the blood sugar levels within the normal range as described in Figure 13.4.

• Insulin stimulates the muscle cells to use glucose in the process of cell respiration.

• Glucagon also promotes the breakdown of fat to release fatty acids that can be metabolised to produce energy.

Failure in the production, secretion and intake of insulin by target cells can cause diabetes mellitus. The blood sugar level of diabetic patients is usually high and unstable after a meal. The patient also feels thirsty, tired, fatigued and suffers weight loss. Diabetes mellitus can be controlled through insulin injections, pills that lower blood sugar levels and a proper diet.

Noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia) is believed to be able to lower high blood pressure. Juice extracted from this fruit has been marketed on a large scale.

Breathing is an involuntary action that is regulated by the respiratory control centre in the medulla oblongata. The respiratory control centre helps maintain homeostasis by controlling the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood (Figure 13.5).

Baroreceptors or pressure receptors are located in the aortic arch and carotid artery (Figure 13.6). The carotid artery is the artery in the neck that supplies blood to the head. These receptors detect the pressure of blood flowing through them and continuously send impulses to the cardiovascular control centre in the medulla oblongata to regulate blood pressure (Figure 13.7).

The human urinary system plays an important role in homeostasis. The urinary system is made up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra (Figure 13.8). The function of the urinary system is to excrete nitrogenous compound wastes such as urea, as well as regulate the volume of body fluids, blood osmotic pressure, ion concentration in body fluids, electrolyte content and blood pH.

The loop of Henle is a long U-shaped tubule that extends to the renal medulla. The distal convoluted tubule of several nephrons join together into a collecting duct.
• The produced urine will flow from the collecting duct into the ureter.

Bowman's capsule is cup-shaped and contains a cluster of blood capillaries called glomerulus. The glomerulus is formed from the afferent arteriole branching from the renal artery. The glomerulus merge again to form the efferent arteriole.

The renal tubules are composed of the proximal convoluted tubules, loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule.

• Each nephron is made up of the following structures:

• Each kidney is made up of millions of functional units called nephrons (Figure 13.9).

Formation of urine
• Bowman's capsule

• Glomerulus

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_96_569_971_1275.jpg" alt="Image" width="80%" /></div>
• Renal tubule

There are three major processes involved in the production of urine, which are ultrafiltration, reabsorption and secretion.

FIGURE 13.9 Structure of the nephron and urine formation

In the loop of Henle, water is reabsorbed through osmosis. Sodium ions are reabsorbed through active transport.
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_123_687_152_721.jpg" alt="Image" width="2%" /></div> <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_122_866_150_902.jpg" alt="Image" width="2%" /></div>
• Secretion gets rid of toxic wastes and helps to regulate the levels of ions in the blood.

The movement of dissolved substances into the blood capillary network reduces the concentration of dissolved substances in the glomerular filtrate but increases the concentration of dissolved substances in the blood capillaries. As a result, water enters the blood capillaries through osmosis.

In the proximal convoluted tubule, sodium ions (Na⁺) are actively pumped into the blood capillary network and chloride ions (Cl⁻) are passively absorbed.

This process is opposite to the process of reabsorption.

Blood entering the glomerulus is under high hydrostatic pressure because the diameter of the afferent arteriole is larger than the diameter of the efferent arteriole. This pressure causes ultrafiltration to occur, that is, fluid seeps through the walls of the glomerulus capillaries into the cavity of Bowman's capsule.

• Secretion occurs through simple diffusion and active transport.

• Secretion is the process of secreting waste materials in the blood that were not filtered earlier into the renal tubules.

Secretion occurs along the renal tubule and collecting duct, but is most active at the distal convoluted tubule.
• In distal convoluted tubules, more water, sodium and chloride ions are reabsorbed.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_576_866_606_902.jpg" alt="Image" width="2%" /></div>
REABSORPTION AT THE LOOP OF HENLE AND DISTAL CONVOLUTED TUBULES
• Reabsorption of the glomerular filtrate occurs along the renal tubule. The dissolved substances permeate across the renal tubular walls into the blood capillary network.

• The amount of water and salts reabsorbed depends on the water and salt content in the blood.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_125_405_155_441.jpg" alt="Image" width="2%" /></div>
• The reabsorption of 100% glucose and amino acids also occurs through active transport.

SECRETION
• Urine contains water, urea, NaCl salt, uric acid and creatinine.

ULTRAFILTRATION IN BOWMAN'S CAPSULE
• The fluid that enters Bowman's capsule is known as the glomerular filtrate.

REABSORPTION AT THE PROXIMAL CONVOLUTED TUBULES
After leaving the collecting duct, urine flows through the ureter, bladder, urethra and is finally excreted.

Red blood cells and plasma proteins remain in the blood flowing to the efferent arteriole because the size of these substances is too large to seep out of the glomerulus.

The glomerular filtrate has the same composition as blood plasma but does not contain red blood cells, platelets and plasma proteins.

URINE FORMATION
• Substances that are secreted include hydrogen ions $ \left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right) $ , potassium ions $ \left(\mathrm{K}^{+}\right) $ , ammonium ions $ \left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right) $ , urea, creatinine, toxic substances and some drugs.

When the renal fluid reaches the collecting duct, only a small amount of salts are left, and most of the water has been absorbed back into the bloodstream.

The remaining renal fluid is now called urine, flows down the collecting duct. Here, a small amount of urea diffuses out into the surrounding fluid and blood capillaries due to its small molecular size.

2 Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are less stimulated.

6 Less concentrated urine is generated in high volumes.

5 Less water is reabsorbed from the renal fluid into the blood capillary.

The body’s water content constantly changes depending on the intake of food and drinks. Osmoregulation is the process of regulating water and salts in the body so that the blood osmotic pressure can be maintained at a normal range. Osmoregulation is achieved by regulating the volume of urine produced by the kidney. Figure 13.10 illustrates the osmoregulation of blood osmotic pressure.

3 The pituitary gland is less stimulated. So, less ADH is secreted from the pituitary gland.

Drinking too much water.

7 Blood osmotic pressure returns to normal.

4 Low ADH concentrations cause the walls of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to become less permeable to water.

Blood osmotic pressure drops to below normal range.

6 Urine that is very concentrated and low in volume is generated.

3 The pituitary gland is stimulated. So, more ADH is secreted from the pituitary gland.

5 More water is absorbed from the renal fluid into the blood capillary.

2 Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are stimulated.

Blood osmotic pressure increases above the normal range.

The skeletal system provides support to humans and animals. There are three types of skeletons, namely, the exoskeleton, endoskeleton and hydrostatic skeleton.

The necessity of skeletal systems in animals and humans
Brainstorm!
Humans and animals need the skeletal system to enable them to move from one place to another in search of food, partners, or to escape from predators and threats.

What are the advantages and disadvantages if humans have exoskeletons like insects?

Most multicellular organisms need support because of their soft body tissues. The exoskeleton found in insects and crabs, support and protect body organs and enable these animals to move. Animals with soft tissues such as earthworms need a hydrostatic skeleton to maintain a rigid body shape. The endoskeleton functions to maintain body shape, support soft body tissues and protect internal organs from injury. You will learn more about the human skeletal system in the following unit.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_100_302_641_568.jpg" alt="Image" width="49%" /></div>
The vertebrae (singular: vertebra) on different parts of the vertebral column differ in size and shape (Figures 14.2–14.7). Each vertebra has an opening known as the neural canal. The spinal cord is located in the neural canal.

The transverse processes (except on the $ 11^{th} $ and $ 12^{th} $ thoracic vertebrae) have facets for articulation with the ribs.

How are these bones joined together to form the skeleton? Bones are too rigid to be bent without breaking. Flexible connective tissues form joints that hold the bones together so that movement can take place. We will learn about the different kinds of joints in the following section.

Joints are points where two or more bones meet, or cartilage and bones meet. Most joints allow the bones to move relative to each other. Different types of joints allow different types of movements. The joints are divided into three types, namely,

• freely moveable joints (for example, hinge joint and ball-and-socket joint) (Figure 14.10)

Joints
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_102_548_957_1403.jpg" alt="Image" width="78%" /></div>
• slightly moveable joints (for example, cartilage discs between the vertebrae, and cartilage between the first rib and sternum) (Figure 14.9)

• immovable joints (for example, suture at the cranium of the skull) (Figure 14.8)

The synovial fluid serves as a lubricant that reduces the friction between the ends of bones.

The synovial membrane secretes synovial fluid into the synovial cavity.

Cartilage serves as a cushion to the joint, absorbs shocks and reduces friction between bone ends. The cartilage also protects the bones from wearing out.

HINGE JOINT
<div style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 14.11 Ball-and-socket joint at the hip</div>
The ball-and-socket joint allows rotational movement in all directions (Figure 14.11). It allows the arm and leg to swing in a circular motion. Examples of ball-and-socket joints are the shoulder joints between the humerus and pectoral girdle, and the hip joint between the femur and pelvic girdle.

The ball-and-socket joint and hinge joint are two examples of freely moveable joints that allow free movements. The general structure of a freely moveable joint and the functions of its parts are shown in Figure 14.10.

BALL-AND-SOCKET JOINT
The capsule is the fibrous tissue that encloses and provides protection to the joint.

The hinge joint allows the movement of bones in one plane (Figure 14.12). For example, the knee joint allows the lower leg to swing back and forth, similar to a hinge on a door. The hinge joint can also be found at the elbow and phalanges of the fingers and toes.

The ligament provides support and strength to joints and allows bones to be bent at the joints.

Bones are held together at the joints by the ligament which consists of strong, elastic and tough connective tissue bundles.

2 State the function of cartilage and synovial fluid in the joint.

1 Name the bones that form the axial skeleton of the human body.

Tendon (connects bone and muscle)
Ligament (connects bone to bone)
The biceps and triceps are examples of antagonistic muscles. The muscle that straightens the limbs when it contracts is called the extensor. For example, the triceps. The muscle that bends the limbs when it contracts is called the flexor. For example, biceps.

The muscles work in pairs and act in opposite directions, that is if one muscle contracts, the other relaxes, and vice versa. These types of muscles are known as antagonistic muscles.

Electroactive plastic polymer is used to produce synthetic muscle. The plastic is used in the production of human-like robots and enables the robots to walk. The synthetic muscle contracts in response to electric current. It is also used to help those with missing limbs.

3 State the differences between the structure and function of tendon and ligament.

4 Explain the differences between the ball-and-socket joint and hinge joint.

The mechanism for the movement of the human forearm involves biceps and triceps. Figure 14.14 shows the action of both antagonistic muscles resulting in the movement of the forearm.

• Consists of strong fibres, not elastic but flexible.

Skeletal muscle
Apart from joints and bones, support and movement also depend on the skeletal muscle, tendon and ligament.

• Comprises bundles of muscle fibres, with a large supply of nerves and blood vessels

3 As the right leg leaves the ground, the body weight is now supported by the left leg which is still on the ground. The quadriceps femoris (extensor) contracts to straighten the leg.

4 The tibialis contracts to bring down the heel. As the right heel touches the ground, body weight is shifted to the right leg. The whole sequence is repeated by the left leg.

2 At the same time, the biceps femoris contracts, bending the foot at the knee joint. The right leg is lifted.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_167_288_493_502.jpg" alt="Image" width="30%" /></div>
Leg movement is produced by the action of the antagonistic muscle pair. The biceps femoris is the flexor whereas the quadriceps femoris is the extensor (Figure 14.15).

The right calf muscle contracts, lifting the heel. The ball of the foot pushes against the ground.
