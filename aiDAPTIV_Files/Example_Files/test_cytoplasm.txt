The food vacuole is combined with lysosome. The food particles are hydrolysed by the enzyme lysozyme in the lysosomes.

Unicellular organisms are made up of only one cell. However, this cell is a complete unit of life like multicellular organisms. Unicellular organisms carry out all life processes: respiration, movement, nutrition, responding to stimulus, reproduction, growth and excretion. Protozoans are the simplest form of unicellular organisms. Examples of protozoa are Amoeba sp. and Paramecium sp. Let us look at the life processes of Amoeba sp. and Paramecium sp.

• Paramecium sp. moves using rhythmic cilia beats.

• When the vacuole expands to the maximum size, contraction occurs and water is excreted from time to time.

• This process is called osmoregulation.

EXCRETION
• As Amoeba sp. and Paramecium sp. live in freshwater environments, water will diffuse by osmosis and fill the contractile vacuole.

Epithelial tissue covers the outer surface (skin) and hollow surfaces in the body (digestive tract and respiratory tract) (Figure 2.4). The epithelial tissue structure is adapted based on its function. For example, the epithelial tissue on the skin protects against infections, injuries, chemicals and dehydration. Epithelial tissues that coat the trachea have projections like hair, known as cilia (singular: cilium).

Nerve tissue
Skeletal muscle is involved in controlled movement. Skeletal muscles contract and relax to generate movement in bones and limbs.

There are three types of muscle tissue: smooth muscle (found in the digestive tract, blood vessel, urinary tract and reproductive tract), skeletal muscle (found in legs and hands) and cardiac muscle (found in the heart wall) (Figure 2.4).

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_750_386_1006_620.jpg" alt="Image" width="23%" /></div>
Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle enable involuntary activities such as peristalsis along the digestive tract.

Cardiac muscle builds walls of the heart that contract to pump blood to the whole body. Cardiac muscle contraction is involuntary.

Nerve tissue is made of neuron or nerve cells (Photograph 2.6). Each neuron consists of a cell body and nerve fibre called dendrite and axon. Nerve tissues can detect stimuli and then send information in the form of an electrical signal (nerve impulses) to the muscles or glands. Nerve tissue regulates and controls body activity.

All cell components perform their respective functions to ensure that the cells function at the optimum level. The collaboration of all the components of the cells is similar to a factory with different parts and each with its specific function. What happens to the cell if there is a deficiency, absence or failure in any of the cell components such as lysosomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts or ribosomes?

2.4 Levels of Organisation in Multicellular Organisms
Failure of the mitochondrion function or a mitochondrion disjunction can cause stunted growth, weak muscles, hearing and vision problems. Tay-Sachs is a hereditary disease caused by the failure of enzymes to produce in the lysosomes. Tay-Sachs patients will experience stunted growth and mental retardation.

2 Briefly describe the structure and function of the nerve tissue.

A group of different tissues combine to form organs. Organs perform special functions as a result of the combination of tissues that form the organ. For example, the heart organ is composed of epithelial tissue, cardiac muscle tissue, connective tissue and nerve tissue. The epithelial tissue fills up space in the heart. Cardiac muscle tissue functions in pumping blood to the rest of the body. Connective tissues such as the blood, connect the systems in the organ. Nerve tissue regulates the rhythm of the heartbeat.

There are 11 main organ systems in the human body (Figure 2.7), which are the respiratory system, digestive system, blood circulatory system, lymphatic system, nervous system, integumentary system, endocrine system, skeletal system, muscular system, urinary system and reproductive system.

• Produces ovum and female sex hormones

• Produces sperm and male sex hormone

• Skeletal muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac muscles

Main function
• Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases between the body and external environment

• Trachea, nose, lungs and diaphragm

Main function

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
MUSCULAR SYSTEM
• Ovary, uterus, Fallopian tube, vagina and cervix

MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
Each multicellular organism is made up of many organs. Different organs work together to carry out a specific function to form an organ system.

Main function
• Spleen, lymph nodes and lymph vessels

LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
• Coordinates body activities with the nervous system

• The endocrine gland that secretes hormones

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
• Maintains balance of bodily fluids and prevents infectious diseases

• Eliminates waste products such as urea and uric acid from the body

• Digests food into a simpler form for easy absorption

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
All the organ systems are coordinated and collaborated as one complete organism. The sequence of the organisation of cells in a multicellular organism is shown in Figure 2.8.

URINARY SYSTEM
SKELETAL SYSTEM
I NTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM
• Bone, cartilage, ligament and tendon

Main function

BLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
NERVOUS SYSTEM
• Supports the body, protects the internal organs and provides a base for muscle adhesion

• Skin

• Mouth, oesophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, small intestine and large intestine

Main function

Main function

• Heart, artery, vein and blood capillary Main function

• Kidney, ureter, urethra and bladder

• Transports nutrients, respiratory gases and waste products

• Detects and sends information in the body, as well as coordinates body activities

Main function

• Brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves
